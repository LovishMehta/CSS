Properties
1) Clip: To generator clipped images. Search for clip path generator on google and generate code from there and copy in css.
2) Box sizing: The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
3) Z-index: The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
         An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
4) Content:The content property is used with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, to insert generated content.

Layout or Display Properties
1) Float: The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 
          The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).

2) clear: The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float.

3) position: The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
    There are five different position values:
    -> static
    -> relative
    -> fixed
    -> absolute
    -> sticky
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
