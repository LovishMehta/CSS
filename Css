What is CSS?
 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
 CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
 CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
 External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
 
 We can write CSS in 3 ways
 1) External style sheet : write in a seperate file and link it to HTML file. Write link tag <link rel="stylesheet" href="your_style_file.css"> inside head tag
 2) Internal style sheet:  use style tag <style> h1{color:blue} </style> inside head tag and write css. i.e. embedding css in html file itself
 3) Inline style: in this also we write inside the html file only. So here we mention style as an attribute of any tag
               ex: <p style="color:blue">
               
 CSS syntax:
 selctor{ property : value } e.g. -> p{color:blue}
 
 Selector
 ElementSelector is used to specify an HTML element or group of HTML elements on which properties are applied.
 Ways to specify an element selector
 1)Type Selector
  -> Uses Tag name to select element -> p{ property : value }

2)ID selector
  -> Used Id value to select elements -> #Id{ property : value }
      e.g. <p id="p1"> then in css we will write #p1{ property : value }. # tells that p1 is ID attribute of an element.

3)Class Selector -> .className{ property : value }
  -> Uses Class value to select elemets
     e.g. <p class ="c1"> then in css we will write .c1{ property : value }. "." tells that c1 is a class attribute of an element.
     
Note: To make group of some particular elements we use class attribute. We give same class name to all those
      elements of html which we want to group together.
     
4)Universal Selector -> *{ property : value }
   *{ color : blue} this will make all the element value as blue. Used to select all the elements at once
 
5)Attribute Selector 
   -> Uses attribute value to select element.
      e.g. element is <a href="www.any.com">. Now to select href attribute we will write a[href="www.any.com"]
 
6)Pseudo Class Selector
   -> Used to style states of element 
      syntax: selector: pseudo-class{ property: value; }
     Example
       Style an element when a user mouses over it -> a:hover{ color: pink }
       Style visited and unvisited links differently -> p:visited{ color: purple }
       Style an element when it gets focus
 
7)Pseudo element Selector
  -> A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
     syntax: selector::pseudo-element{  property: value; }
     For example, it can be used to: 
       Style the first letter, or line, of an element -> p::first-line{ color:pink }
       Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
       
8)Combinator Selectors
  A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors
  There are four different combinators in CSS:
  -> descendant selector (space)
  -> child selector (>) article > p { property:value; }
  -> adjacent sibling selector (+)
  -> general sibling selector (~)
