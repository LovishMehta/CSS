Media Queries
Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
-> width and height of the viewport
-> width and height of the device
-> orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
   resolution
   
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}

Data Attribute
The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
